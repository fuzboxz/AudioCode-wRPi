/**
 * In this task, you are being passed a Hashtable with three elements, a MIDI note, a base-freq and a set of octave
 * frequencies. The data in the Hashtable may be wrong. The MIDI value is always correct. The base-freq should
 * correspond to the MIDI value, and the octaves value should contain for floats representing the frequencies of the
 * four octaves above the base-freq.
 *
 * You will be passed one Hashtable, as in the example below. You should do two things:
 *
 * 1) check the data in the Hashtable and report which information is wrong. e.g., if the base-freq is wrong then output
 * a line saying base-freq. If the first element in the octaves array is wrong then output a line saying octaves0, then
 * octaves1 for the second element and so on.
 *
 * 2) correct the data in the Hashtable. After your task is completed, the Hashtable will be checked for correctness,
 * including making sure there are no extra elements.
